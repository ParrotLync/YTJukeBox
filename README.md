# YTJukeBox
Youtube addon for MCJukebox

### What does it do?
While MCJukebox is a great plugin, you have to host your own audio files. This is not an easy option for everyone. With this plugin you can play audio directly from Youtube! The files are hosted on our server, so you don't have to deal with it.

#### How does it work?
It's easy! Like MCJukebox, you can choose to play your media as music or as sound effect:
`/youtube music <player/@show> <youtube url>`
`/youtube sound <player/@show> <youtube url>`

#### Permissions
- ytjukebox.use - Use YTJukebox commands

#### Dependencies

### Hosting
If you use the plugin, we'll take care of the hosting. This is however expensive. If you'd like to help me out, you can donate here https://paypal.me/ipICT :). If you want to go for a self-hosted option, no problem! Send me a message and I'll send you the files and help you out.
